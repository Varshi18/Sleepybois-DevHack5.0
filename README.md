# Sleepy boys
 DevHack5.0 team project
 We are choosing the AI/ML Track for our project. It will primarily be based on AI Image detection.

This model is made on Yolov5 free package running on python

To run this Application, execute the detect3.py file on the compiler (install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt)

The Application runs an AI chatbot and Object detection process at the same time, integrating it seamlessly for immersive experience.
For activating the chatbot, start casually by hello, etc.
Few common commands are:
1. hello: greets you
2. time: tells you the time and day
3. open browser: opens default browser
4. search: opens search result from google chrome
5. info: speaks out the information about the subject from wikipedia
6. detect image: turns on our Object detection model and scans the surroundings


We wish to implement OpenAI's API in future to make it understand the environment and take actions accordingly
If you wish to have higher level of object detection, change the weights by running the Yolov5X model which has higher amount of database and more precision


Keep dreaming, Keep achieving!!
